## How to build
BleskOS is completly written in assembly language and can be compiled using NASM. You should use the latest version (2.1)

compile.sh is written for linux systems. After download, you have to check in properties "Allow executing file as program" or you can enter the following in your terminal: ```chmod +x compile.sh``` and you can compile BleskOS by running this file.

If you do not use linux, you can build BleskOS by this steps:
1. compile bootloader/bootloader.asm to bootloader.bin
2. compile source/bleskos.asm to bleskos.bin
3. create file bleskos.img
4. write bootloader.bin from first sector(LBA 0) to bleskos.img
5. write bleskos.bin from sixth sector(LBA 5) to bleskos.img
6. connect file bleskos.img to emulator as hard disk
7. and start emulator
